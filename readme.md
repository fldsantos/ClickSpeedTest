# Click Speed Test

## Small project to help me understand TypeScript, and get used to building other projects with this language

### This program tracks how many times you click your mouse, and calculates your clicks per second. It then displays your level of speed, comparing with the speed of animals.

I used a similar tool in [this website](https://clickspeedtest.com/) so I could train my click speed, when I was a kid. It was a fun project to work on, and it helped me understand typescript a lot better.

This project was done in around 12 hours. Here is a video showing its functionalities and design.

# Development Environment

This project was written in Visual Studio Code. I had to download LiveServer to work on the interface while working on the code, and I also had to download the TypeScript compiler, so it would convert the code to Javascript. I also used vanilla HTML and CSS to work on the front end.

The programming language I used was Typescript, and I used some of its unique features.

# Future Work

Some ideas I intend to add in the future

- Adding an option to choose how many seconds you'll click for.
- Add a pop up to display the results, instead of making it static
- Rewrite the front end and make it prettier
